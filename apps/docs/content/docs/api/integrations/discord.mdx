  We highly recommend reading the [Discord Developers documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) for in-depth help, and navigating through Discord's API.

Add Discord integration to your agent by following these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Discord bot application
   - Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Click **"New Application"** and give it a name

### Step 2: Configure bot settings
   - From the sidebar, go to the **Bot** section to get the **Token**.
   - Click on **Reset Token** to get your Token and save it somewhere securely.

  Make sure to enable all three options here.
  - **Presence Intent** ✓
  - **Server Members Intent** ✓
  - **Message Content Intent** ✓

### Step 3: Add the bot to your server

  - From the sidebar, go to the **OAuth2** section
  - At the **OAuth2 URL Generator**, check the `bot` option

  - In the **Bot Permissions**, give the relevant permissions to the bot. To enable the bot to talk in the server and respond to messages, you should check **"Send Messages"**. You can check other permissions based on what you want your bot to do.

  - Scroll down a bit to copy the URL:
  <Image src="/images/integrations/Copy-url.png" width={740} height={300} className='rounded-md'/>

  - **Paste** this URL in a new tab where you will have to:

   1) Select the server you want to add the bot to
   2) Authorize the bot

### Step 4: Create and Configure your Agent

Run this command to create an Upstreet Agent:
```bash
usdk create
```

Add the following Component to your Agent:
```tsx
import { Discord } from 'react-agents';

// ... 
return (
<Agent>
  {/* ... */}
  <Discord
    token="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" // The bot token from Step 2
    channels={[
      "general", // Text channel names the bot should listen to
      "voice-chat" // Voice channel names the bot should listen to
    ]}
    dms={true} // Enable direct messages with the bot
    userWhitelist={[ // Optional: restrict which users can interact
      "user1#1234",
      "user2#5678"
    ]}
  />
  {/* ... */}
</Agent>
);
```

Run the following command to get your Discord Agent up and running.

```bash
usdk chat
```

You can now test it in the connected Discord server! Just mention it in one of the channels you specified, and see it talk.

You can see a more detailed guide for this in our [_Discord Agent_](/examples/discord-agent) example.

## Additional Notes
- The bot will only respond in the specified channels and to whitelisted users (if configured)
- Voice channel support requires additional Discord permissions (see above)
- Channel names are case-sensitive and should match exactly
- For DMs, users must share a server with the bot
- The bot token should be kept secure and not committed to version control.
- You can use `.env.txt` and the useEnv() hook to load it at runtime.
- If you need to reset the token for security reasons, you can do so in the Discord Developer Portal
- The bot requires a stable internet connection to maintain WebSocket connection with Discord
- Rate limits apply to bot actions - see Discord's [developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) for details
