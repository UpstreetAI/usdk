React Agents is a groundbreaking framework that brings the power and familiarity of [React](https://react.dev) to AI agent development. Built on React's [reconciliation engine](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-reconciler/README.md), it enables developers to create intelligent, autonomous agents using the same tools and patterns they love from React development.

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { Agent, Action } from '@upstreet/agents';
import { z } from 'zod';

function SmartHomeAgent() {
  return (
    <Agent>
      <Action
        name="turnOnLights"
        description="Turn on the lights in my room"
        schema={z.object({ lightName: z.string() })}
        examples={[{ lightName: 'bedroom' }]}
        handler={(e) => {
          turnOnLights();
          e.data.agent.monologue(`Lights changed: ${e.data.message.args.lightName}`);
        }}
      />
    </Agent>
  );
}
```

## Core Concepts

### The React Agents Architecture

React Agents leverages the [React Reconciler API](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-reconciler/README.md) to create a custom renderer specifically designed for AI agents. This architecture provides several key advantages:

1. **Server-First Design**: Optimized for server-side execution
2. **Platform Agnostic**: Ready for multi-platform and edge deployments
3. **Declarative**: Uses React's component model and lifecycle
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout the stack

### Traditional React vs React Agents

Let's compare how you'd implement similar functionality in traditional React versus React Agents:

#### Traditional React
```jsx
// User interface focused
function LightControl() {
  const [lightName, setLightName] = useState('');
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={(e) => turnOnLights(e.target.lightName.value)}>
      <label>Light Name:</label>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={lightName}
        onChange={(e) => setLightName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Turn On Light</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

#### React Agents
```jsx
// Agent behavior focused
function LightControlAgent() {
  return (
    <Agent>
      <Action
        name="turnOnLights"
        description="turn on the lights in my room"
        schema={z.object({ lightName: z.string() })}
        examples={[{ lightName: 'bedroom' }]}
        handler={handleLightChange}
      />
    </Agent>
  );
}
```

The key difference lies in the focus: traditional React components render user interfaces, while React Agents components render agent behaviors and capabilities.

## Core Components

### Agent
The root component that initializes an agent instance.

```jsx
<Agent
  name="HomeAssistant"
  description="A helpful assistant for home automation"
>
  {/* Agent actions and behaviors */}
</Agent>
```

### Action
Defines discrete capabilities that an agent can perform.

```jsx
<Action
  name="setTemperature"
  description="Set the temperature of a room"
  schema={z.object({
    room: z.string(),
    temperature: z.number()
  })}
  handler={handleTemperatureChange}
/>
```

## How It Works

React Agents operates through a sophisticated pipeline:

1. **JSX Transformation**: Your component code is transformed into an agent execution plan
2. **Prompt Generation**: The execution plan is converted into a series of prompts
3. **Chain-of-Thought Runtime**: Prompts are processed through a reasoning engine
4. **Action Execution**: The agent performs actions based on its reasoning
5. **State Updates**: Results are reconciled back through React's system

## Best Practices

### 1. Schema Definition
Always define precise schemas for your actions:

```jsx
const schema = z.object({
  action: z.enum(['on', 'off']),
  device: z.string(),
  room: z.string().optional()
});
```

### 2. Provide Examples
Include clear examples for better agent understanding:

```jsx
const examples = [
  { action: 'on', device: 'lights', room: 'living room' },
  { action: 'off', device: 'thermostat' }
];
```

### 3. Error Handling
Implement robust error handling in your handlers:

```jsx
const handler = async (e) => {
  try {
    await performAction(e.data.message.args);
    e.data.agent.monologue('Action completed successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    e.data.agent.monologue(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  }
};
```

## Command Reference

For a complete list of available commands and their usage, refer to our [Command Reference Guide](/concepts/agents-sdk/command-reference).

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Renderers
Create specialized renderers for unique use cases:

```jsx
const customRenderer = createAgentRenderer({
  supportedEvents: ['custom.event'],
  transformEvent: (event) => ({
    type: 'custom.event',
    payload: event
  })
});
```

### State Management
Integrate with existing React state management solutions:

```jsx
function AgentWithState() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  
  return (
    <Agent context={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {/* Agent components */}
    </Agent>
  );
}
```
