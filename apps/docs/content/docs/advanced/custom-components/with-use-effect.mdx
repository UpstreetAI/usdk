[`useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.

```tsx
useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```

### Explanation

- Manages side effects in functional components.
- Executes after the component renders and re-runs when dependencies change.

### Usecase

- Connecting to an external system
- Wrapping Effects in custom Hooks
- Controlling a non-React widget
- Fetching data with Effects
- Specifying reactive dependencies
- Updating state based on previous state from an Effect


### Step 1:  Integrate useEffect with Upstreet agents to build a component that generate random names

- Install the Upstreet SDK using `usdk create`

- Navigate to the `agent.tsx` file.

- You will find a pre-built `MyAgent` component like that. 
```tsx
export default function MyAgent() {
  return (
    <Agent>
   
    </Agent>
  )
}
```

<Callout>
In this example `useState` and `useEffect` both are being utilized.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Import dependencies and create `SimpleAgentEffect` component 

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Prompt } from "react-agents";
```

Now create a component named `SimpleAgentEffect` and set your states using `useState`

```tsx

const SimpleAgentEffect = () => {
 const [message, setMessage] = useState("Fetching message...");

  return (
    <>
      
    </>
  );
};
```

After defining the useState, the useEffect is being used to display a greeting from the agent and update the message state

```tsx
 useEffect(() => {
    const greet = async () => {
      const simulatedAgentResponse = "Hello! I'm here to assist you.";
      setMessage(simulatedAgentResponse);
    };

    greet(); 
  }, []);

```
This code runs after the component renders, triggering the agent to say "Hello! I'm here to assist you," 
and updates the `message` state to indicate the greeting was sent, with the effect re-running whenever the `agent` changes.

### Step 3: Modify the `SimpleAgentEffect` component 

Give agent a customized `Prompt` 


```tsx
  <Prompt>
        Engage the user by discussing their generated name, "{name}". Offer insights or lore about their name and suggest if they want to generate a new one.
      </Prompt>
```

Display the message here 

```tsx
  {message && <p>{message}</p>}
```

The final state of `SimpleAgentEffect` look like this.

```tsx

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Prompt } from "@upstreet/agents";

const SimpleGreetingAgent = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("Initializing...");

   useEffect(() => {
    const greet = async () => {
      const simulatedAgentResponse = "Hello! I'm here to assist you.";
      setMessage(simulatedAgentResponse);
    };

    greet(); // Call the simulated greeting
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <Prompt>
        The agent greets the user with: "{message}".
      </Prompt>
      {message && <p>{message}</p>}
    </>
  );
};

export default SimpleGreetingAgent;

```


### Step 4: Import `SimpleAgentEffect` in the `Agent` Components

```tsx
export default function MyAgent() {
  return (
    <Agent>
   <SimpleAgentEffect/>
    </Agent>
  )
}
```

### Step 5: Test the agent

Run `usdk chat` in the terminal to test the agent.

**As soon as the agent render it will greet you.**
