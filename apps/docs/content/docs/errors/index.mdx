## Could not run the speaker module

This error may occur when running `usdk chat` locally. The CLI uses operating system-specific audio output backends to play audio, and installing the necessary dependencies may be required to enable audio functionality in the CLI.

To resolve this, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Install System Build Tools
Some operating systems require specific build tools to compile and run audio modules:

- **macOS**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools. Run the following command:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
  
- **Windows**: Install Visual Studio Build Tools with **C++ environment support**.

### Step 2: Reinstall `usdk` Globally
After installing the required system build tools, reinstall `usdk` globally to ensure that all dependencies are properly configured:

```bash
npm install -g usdk
```

Here's how the "Running `usdk` in PowerShell" section could look to integrate your instructions effectively:

## Running `usdk` in PowerShell

When running `usdk` in PowerShell, you might encounter an error related to the Node.js directory. PowerShell has a known issue with the Node.js installation path, which may prevent `usdk` from running smoothly.

### Solution 1: Switch to CMD
As a quick workaround, consider using the Command Prompt (CMD) instead of PowerShell to run `usdk`:

1. Open a new terminal.
2. Select **Command Prompt** instead of **PowerShell**.
3. Run your `usdk` commands in CMD.

### Solution 2: Set Prefix in .npmrc File
To configure Node.js to work in PowerShell, you can specify the installation path using the `.npmrc` file. This approach sets an explicit prefix path, helping to resolve any directory issues in PowerShell.

#### Steps to Set the Prefix:
1. Open PowerShell.
2. Run the following command to open your `.npmrc` file in Notepad:
   ```powershell
   Notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.npmrc"
   ```
3. In the `.npmrc` file, add the following line to set the Node.js prefix:
   ```plaintext
   prefix = "C:/Program Files/nodejs"
   ```
4. Save the file and restart PowerShell.

After following these steps, PowerShell should recognize the Node.js installation path correctly, allowing `usdk` to run without directory-related issues.
