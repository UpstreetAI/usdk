Upstreet AI Agents are fully customizable digital entities that autonomously handle tasks, communicate, and interact according to your configuration.

## Quickstart: Creating an Agent
With Upstreet, getting started is easy. Here’s how to set up your first Agent.

### Step 1: Running the command

1. **Set up your project directory**  
   First, create an empty directory where you’d like to set up your Agent.
   
2. **Run the Command in your terminal**
   ```bash
   usdk create
   ```
   Run the above command in your terminal within your new directory. This will launch a guided interview, where you’ll define essential properties of your Agent.

   You can see more options by running `usdk create --help`.

### Step 2: Complete the Agent Interview

The `usdk create` command initiates an interactive “interview” process with the **Interviewer**. Here’s what to expect:

1. **Interactive Prompts**  
   The SDK will prompt you with questions, helping you define your Agent's personality, environment, and other key settings.

2. **Simulated Chat with Your Agent**  
   You’ll be able to “converse” with the **Interviewer**, defining the Agent's Homespace (its natural habitat) and personality traits through chat-based interactions.

3. **Completion**  
   Once all required fields are captured, the interview concludes, setting up all the Agent features and initialising the necessary files in your directory.

### File Structure

Assuming you’ve named your project directory “my-agent,” here’s the structure you’ll see post-setup:

<Wrapper>
<Files className='max-w-lg w-full'>
  <Folder name='my-agent' defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="wrangler" />
    <Folder name="node_modules" disabled />
    <Folder name="packages" />
    <Folder name="codecs" />
    <Folder name="tests" />
    <File name="agent.tsx" />
    <File name="jest.config.mjs" />
    <File name="jest.setup.mjs" />
    <File name="package-lock.json" />
    <File name="package.json" />
    <File name="tsconfig.json" />
    <File name="wrangler.toml" />
    <File name="README.md" />
  </Folder>
</Files>
</Wrapper>

For a breakdown of these files, see our [Agent Structure guide]((/concepts/agents-sdk/agent-structure)).

Remember to keep your Agent’s configuration secure. Avoid making this repository public on platforms like GitHub, as sensitive keys could be exposed.

## What's next?

Now that you've set up your base Agent, you can choose to dive deeper into Agent customization and potential capabilities by [writing code in React](/customize-your-agent).

If you wish to skip customization and directly launch your Agent on our Platform, you can check out [Testing your Agent](/test-your-agent) and [Deploying your Agent](/deploy-your-agent).
