In this guide, we build an **Informative Agent** inspired by the [Pokédex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex) in the Pokémon franchise, an encyclopedia device capable of retrieving Pokémon information and having conversations with its user.

<Callout>
We define an **Informative Agent** as an Agent which can retrieve information from an **API** or the **internet**.

The source code for this example is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/UpstreetAI/usdk-examples/tree/main/pokedex).

## Guide

### Step 1: Setup `usdk`

Follow _[Setup the SDK](/install)_ to set up NodeJS and `usdk`.

### Step 2: Create an Agent (shortcut)

We can skip the Interview process, and directly generate an Agent with a prompt, by running:

```bash
usdk create <your-agent-directory> -p "create a pokedex assistant agent" -y
```

This will directly scaffold an Agent for you in `<your-agent-directory>`. [Learn more](/create-an-agent#file-structure)

### Step 3: Create a `PokeDexAssistant` Component

As of November 12, 2024, there are **1,025** Pokémon in the National Pokédex. That's a lot of Pokémon!

So instead of keeping the Pokédex database in memory, we'll use [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) - an open-source (and free) Pokémon API - to retrieve Pokémon information at runtime.

We'll have to create a [custom Component](/concepts/agents-sdk/creating-custom-components) to retrieve Pokémon information from the PokéAPI. For the sake of this example, we'll keep it simple:

```tsx
const PokemonDexAssistant = () => {

  // We'll add functions, useState, useEffect here

  return (
    <>
        {/* We can add components here to compose our Agent  */}
    </>
  );
}
```

Now add a helper function to retrieve the Pokémon data, and also two more to filter them by abilities and moves:


```tsx
const PokemonDexAssistant = () => {

    const fetchPokemonDetails = async (pokemonName: string) => { // [!code ++]
        const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemonName}`);// [!code ++]
        const data = await response.json();// [!code ++]
        return data;// [!code ++]
    };// [!code ++]
// [!code ++]
    const fetchPokemonAbilities = async (pokemonName: string) => {// [!code ++]
        const response = await fetchPokemonDetails(pokemonName);// [!code ++]
        const abilities = response.abilities;// [!code ++]
        return abilities;// [!code ++]
    };// [!code ++]
// [!code ++]
    const fetchPokemonMovesNames = async (pokemonName: string) => {// [!code ++]
        const response = await fetchPokemonDetails(pokemonName);// [!code ++]
        const moves = response.moves.map(move => move.move.name);// [!code ++]
        return moves;// [!code ++]
    };// [!code ++]
        

  return (
    <>
        {/* We can add components here to compose our Agent  */}
    </>
  );
}
```

Now comes the interesting part. We'll use the [`<Action>`](/install) tag to define how the Agent should respond to the default text perception.

To say that simply, we want the Agent to know that it can fetch Pokémon details whenever a user messages them.


```tsx

import { z } from 'zod'; // [!code ++]

const PokemonDexAssistant = () => {

    const fetchPokemonDetails = async (pokemonName: string) => { 
        const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemonName}`);
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    };

    const fetchPokemonAbilities = async (pokemonName: string) => {
        const response = await fetchPokemonDetails(pokemonName);
        const abilities = response.abilities;
        return abilities;
    };

    const fetchPokemonMovesNames = async (pokemonName: string) => {
        const response = await fetchPokemonDetails(pokemonName);
        const moves = response.moves.map(move => move.move.name);
        return moves;
    };
        

  return (
    <>
        <Action  // [!code ++]
        name='fetchPokemonMoves' // [!code ++]
        description="Retrieve a list of move names for a given Pokemon from the PokeAPI" // [!code ++]
        schema={ // [!code ++]
            z.object({ // [!code ++]
            pokemonName: z.string(), // [!code ++]
            }) // [!code ++]
        } // [!code ++]
        examples={[ // [!code ++]
            {  // [!code ++]
            pokemonName: 'pikachu', // [!code ++]
            }, // [!code ++]
        ]} // [!code ++]
        handler={ // [!code ++]
            async (e: PendingActionEvent) => { // [!code ++]
            const { pokemonName } = e.data.message.args as { pokemonName: string }; // [!code ++]
            const moves =await fetchPokemonMovesNames(pokemonName); // [!code ++]
            const monologueString = dedent`\ // [!code ++]
                Your character fetched details about a pokemon's moves and discovered the following: // [!code ++]
            ` + '\n\n' + moves; // [!code ++]
            await e.data.agent.monologue(monologueString);   // [!code ++]
            await e.commit(); // [!code ++]
            } // [!code ++]
        } // [!code ++]
        /> 
        <Action // [!code ++]
        name="fetchPokemonAbilities" // [!code ++]
        description="Retrieve a list of ability names for a given Pokemon from the PokeAPI" // [!code ++]
        schema={ // [!code ++]
            z.object({ // [!code ++]
            pokemonName: z.string(), // [!code ++]
            }) // [!code ++]
        } // [!code ++]
        examples={[ // [!code ++]
            {  // [!code ++]

        ]} // [!code ++]
        handler={ // [!code ++]
            async (e: PendingActionEvent) => { // [!code ++]
            const { pokemonName } = e.data.message.args as { pokemonName: string }; // [!code ++]
            const abilities = await fetchPokemonAbilities(pokemonName); // [!code ++]
            const monologueString = dedent`\
Your character fetched details about a pokemon's abilities and discovered the following:
            ` + '\n\n' + abilities; // [!code ++]
            await e.data.agent.monologue(monologueString);   // [!code ++]
            await e.commit(); // [!code ++]
            } // [!code ++]
        } // [!code ++]
        />
    </>
  );
}
```

Let's break down one of the Actions, and understand it.

#### Breakdown summary of the `<Action>` Component

1. **Purpose of the `<Action>` Component**  
   `<Action>` components define specific actions that your agent can perform in response to user inputs. In this case, the agent retrieves Pokémon-related details like abilities and moves from the PokéAPI.

2. **Defining Action Properties**
   Each `<Action>` is structured with the following properties:
   - **`name`**: A unique identifier for the action. Example: `'fetchPokemonMoves'`.
   - **`description`**: Explains what the action does. This helps developers understand its purpose.
   - **`schema`**: Specifies the input structure for the action, defined using a `zod` schema. Here, the input is a Pokémon's name (`pokemonName`), and the schema ensures it's a string.
   - **`examples`**: Provides sample inputs for testing or guiding the agent's behavior. Example: `{ pokemonName: 'pikachu' }`.

3. **`handler`: The Action's Core Logic**
   The `handler` function is where the actual functionality of the action is implemented:
   - **Input Processing**: The `e.data.message.args` extracts the input (`pokemonName`) from the user's request.
   - **Calling Helper Functions**: Helper functions like `fetchPokemonMovesNames` or `fetchPokemonAbilities` are invoked to fetch data from the PokéAPI.
   - **Building the Response**: The results are formatted into a string (e.g., a monologue) using `dedent` for cleaner output.
   - **Responding to the User**: The agent sends a response via `e.data.agent.monologue`.
   - **Marking Action Completion**: The `await e.commit()` call signals that the action is complete.

#### The `fetchPokemonMoves` Action
   
   Learn about the basics of Actions [here](/concepts/agents-sdk).

   Let's break apart the `fetchPokemonMoves` Action. This action retrieves a Pokémon's move names:
   - **Schema Validation**: Ensures `pokemonName` is a valid string.
   - **Fetch Logic**: The `fetchPokemonMovesNames` helper gets the moves from the API.
   - **User Feedback**: The response lists the moves and delivers them back to the user.

   ```tsx
   <Action 
       name="fetchPokemonMoves"
       description="Retrieve a list of move names for a given Pokemon from the PokeAPI"
       schema={z.object({ pokemonName: z.string() })}
       examples={[{ pokemonName: 'pikachu' }]}
       handler={async (e: PendingActionEvent) => {
           const { pokemonName } = e.data.message.args as { pokemonName: string };
           const moves = await fetchPokemonMovesNames(pokemonName);
           const monologueString = dedent`
               Your character fetched details about a Pokémon's moves and discovered the following:
           ` + '\n\n' + moves;
           await e.data.agent.monologue(monologueString);
           await e.commit();
       }}
   />
   ```

You can define multiple `<Action>` components, each tailored to a specific purpose. For example:
- `fetchPokemonAbilities`: Fetches abilities using `fetchPokemonAbilities`.
- `fetchPokemonMoves`: Fetches moves using `fetchPokemonMovesNames`.

Finally, we call `<PokeDexAssistant />` in our Agent's main code:
```tsx title="agent.tsx"
// ...

export default function MyAgent() {
  return (
    <Agent>
        {/* [!code highlight] */} 
      <PokemonDexAssistant />
    </Agent>
  );
}
```

You can see the complete code for this component on GitHub [here](https://github.com/UpstreetAI/usdk-examples/blob/5d1e2299ff4a518c0791f8e3c8a49143eb1fecc2/pokedex/agent.tsx#L13).

### Step 4: Test out your Pokédex-like Agent!

You can run `usdk chat` to test it out. [Learn more](/test-your-agent)

You can ask it questions like:
> What are Charizard's top abilities?

Share its response in our [Discord community](https://upstreet.ai/usdk-discord); we'd love to know what it responds to you.
